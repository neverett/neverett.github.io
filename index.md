title: About me
---

I am a data engineer and data analyst who lives in Chicago. I enjoy building ETL/ELT pipelines to transform messy data into cleaned and reshaped database tables and views that organizers, analysts, researchers, and journalists can query with confidence.

For data wrangling, I often use the PETL, polars, and Parsons Python libraries, as well as good old fashioned SQL in dbt models. I have a lot of experience using Civis Platform for pipeline orchestration, but lately I've been using Prefect Core, and sometimes even makefiles and cron jobs, depending on the needs of the project. I used Amazon Redshift extensively in my last job, MySQL in previous projects, and recently have been diving deep on PostgreSQL and SQLite.

I'm starting to dip my toe into data visualization with the Plotly Python library and Dash, and data publishing with Datasette, inspired by the [Public Utility Data Liberation Project (PUDL)](https://catalyst.coop/pudl/).

I like working with people and organizations committed to police abolition, decarceration, labor power, and environmental justice.
