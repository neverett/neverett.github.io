title: About me
---

I am a Chicago-based technical writer and data engineer. I also like to swim in Lake Michigan, make decadent lasagna, and play the viola.

As a **technical writer**, I enjoy partnering with engineers and other technical experts to write docs that make their lives easier, and have written development environment setup docs, onboarding docs, code style guides, troubleshooting procedures, incident response manuals, and other modern poetry. I also have a lot of experience writing product documentation for audiences at all levels of technical ability, particularly for software used by engineers (e.g. npm and GitHub).

I prefer writing docs in Markdown, and have used Jekyll and the Liquid template language to manage their conversion to HTML, and can quickly become proficient in any Markdown/reST-to-HTML publishing software. I have also written docs in GitHub wikis and Confluence, and published docs in MadCap Flare. I like using a pull/merge request process to draft and review docs, getting and giving feedback early and often, and continuously shipping docs to keep pace with the speed of modern software development.


As a **data engineer**, I enjoy building ETL/ELT pipelines to transform messy data into cleaned and reshaped database tables and views that organizers, analysts, researchers, and journalists can query with confidence.

For data wrangling, I often use the PETL, polars, and Parsons Python libraries, as well as good old fashioned SQL in dbt models. I have a lot of experience using Civis Platform for pipeline orchestration, but lately I've been using Prefect Core, and sometimes even makefiles and cron jobs, depending on the needs of the project. I used Amazon Redshift extensively in my last job, MySQL in previous projects, and PostgreSQL and SQLite for my most recent data work.

I'm starting to dip my toe into data visualization with the Plotly Python library and Dash, and data publishing with Datasette, inspired by the [Public Utility Data Liberation Project (PUDL)](https://catalyst.coop/pudl/).

I like working with people and organizations committed to police abolition, decarceration, labor power, and environmental justice.
