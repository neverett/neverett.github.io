title: About me
---

Hello, I'm Nikki. I live in Chicago and I like to help people use technology. I've written software documentation for people of all levels of technical ability, provided tech support, fixed data pipelines, and written code for my day job(s) and as a volunteer supporting activists and organizers.

When I'm not on the computer, I like to read and write fiction, [lift weights](https://www.shesabeast.co/about/), and [watch movies]](https://www.celluloidchicago.org/).

## Contact

I like working with people and organizations committed to police and prison abolition, labor power, and environmental justice. If that sounds like you, reach out to me at everettn AT protonmail DOT com.
