title: About me
---

I am a Chicago-based technical writer and data engineer. I also like to swim in Lake Michigan, make decadent lasagna, and play the viola.

As a **technical writer**, I enjoy partnering with technical teams to write and update docs to make their lives easier, and have written everything from development environment setup docs to code style guides to incident response procedures and other modern poetry. I am also very experienced at writing product documentation, particularly for software used by engineers (npm and GitHub).

I have extensive experience wrting docs in Markdown, using Jekyll and the Liquid template langauge to manage docs, and can quickly learn any Markdown/ReST-to-HTML publishing software. I have also written docs in GitHub wikis and Confluence, and published docs in MadCap Flare. I am experienced at documenting technical processes for audiences at all levels of technical ability, and love creating a culture of documentation everywhere I go, regardless of my role. 


As a **data engineer**, I enjoy building ETL/ELT pipelines to transform messy data into cleaned and reshaped database tables and views that organizers, analysts, researchers, and journalists can query with confidence.

For data wrangling, I often use the PETL, polars, and Parsons Python libraries, as well as good old fashioned SQL in dbt models. I have a lot of experience using Civis Platform for pipeline orchestration, but lately I've been using Prefect Core, and sometimes even makefiles and cron jobs, depending on the needs of the project. I used Amazon Redshift extensively in my last job, MySQL in previous projects, and PostgreSQL and SQLite for my most recent data work.

I'm starting to dip my toe into data visualization with the Plotly Python library and Dash, and data publishing with Datasette, inspired by the [Public Utility Data Liberation Project (PUDL)](https://catalyst.coop/pudl/).

I like working with people and organizations committed to police abolition, decarceration, labor power, and environmental justice.
